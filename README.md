# magnolia-populations
There are 411 csv point values in the IUCN Red List data for magnolia species globally. The country of Ecuador is a hotspot for this species, 310 of the csv values, and has lots of diversity through subspecies within the country. I have chosen to focus my map within Ecuador, and have used a heatmap display to show density amongst the different provinces.
